Sentiment is powered by Zama’s Concrete-ML—a Logistic Regression compiled to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) circuits, so inference can run on encrypted data (fhe="execute"), showcasing privacy-preserving ML.
FHE behavior is toggleable via FHE_MODE (disable/simulate/execute), making it practical on small servers while still demonstrating Zama’s FHE pipeline.
Clean JSON API, CORS-secured, and environment-driven config (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL).
